TODO:
- Menu
- Gitignore
- Mine explosions should use a frame animation type of system
- Memoryleaks
- When a player runs into an enemy or the other way around, they should push each other away.
  * What happens if both players are moving forward and right into each other at the same time? No movement?
  * Run a check if the new position of the enemy won't be inside a wall.
    > Can't place this check in Enemy::SetPosX/Y because we need to know whether we substract or add co-ordinates to the movement position in order to then do the opposite in order to move out of the wall/etc.
  * Remember to also add this functionality to the Enemy class for when a player tank is on their waypoint path.
  * Move other unit away based on their current movement speed.
- Properly get rid of bullets instead of setting their position to out of the game (which is obviously just a temporarily solution).
- Remove bullets from Game::allBullets when they exploded.
- Create public class 'Unit' for classes Player and Enemy for shared functionalities.
- Implement a method to identify enemies (guids held in database perhaps?) so we can properly reduce bullet count when a bullet is shot.

DONE:
- Figure out why distance check for landmine explosions isn't working (the 2D distance formula should work...)
- Figure out issues with collision on some of the walls. Possible cause might be that we stop iterating over walls when we found a collision.





- Landmines no longer start their timer from scratch when walking over one while it's already counting down.
